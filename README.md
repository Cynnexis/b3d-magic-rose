# Magic Rose :rose: :sparkles:

Blender project using shaders to materialize a magical rose.

## Idea

This project is a copy of [Polyfjord][polyfjord]'s video [This Video Took 30 Days to Create With Blender - The sun is getting real low](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vJL9PnbpQc&t=180s). I wanted to reproduce the steps he made based on the original video, and his [breakdown video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VUOyptldRE&t=1598s).

## Getting Started

To open this project, you will need Blender 4.0 with the following extensions:

- [Graswald][graswald]

Then open `b3d-magic-rose.blend`, which contains the main project. You can then render the whole project into EXR videos, and then compile them into a video using `video.blend`.

## Credits

### Concept

- Big thanks to [Polyfjord][polyfjord] and his videos about the original magical rose.

### Tools

- [Graswald][graswald] for creating a simple but very realistic grass effect.
- [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) for sound and music editing. I used it to clip the music and assemble and reverse the glass breaking sound effects listed below.
